This study is grounded in the analysis of the Cardiovascular Disease Dataset sourced from the Kaggle website (Ulianova, S., 2018) C. The data is a collection of 70,000 patient records which is obtained at the moment of a medical examination. The targeted population comprises all individuals (patients) undergoing the medical examination.

The purpose of this project is to estimate the average pulse pressure of all patients in the medical examination and the proportion of all patients having high pulse pressure in the medical examination. Simple random sampling (SRS) and stratified sampling methods are applied to this study to provide more valuable insights. Our goal is to provide a nuanced insight into pulse pressure levels across a diverse population. It enables public health planners to finely tailor interventions and educational campaigns, fostering the development of targeted strategies that promote heart health and proactively prevent cardiovascular diseases.
